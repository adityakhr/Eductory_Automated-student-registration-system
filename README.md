Hello,<br>
Welcome to the Automatic Students Registration System, I named it as "Eductory". You can find logo below of my Application.<br>


<img src=logo/Eductory.png style="width:60%" >

<br>
Here in this project you can find above in src folder 4 class that I have made and which are as follows..<br>
1. Courses<br>
2. Batch<br>
3. Students<br>
4. Main<br>
As the names are indicating they are classes for generating the various objects first class is used to creating the course and it has the list of batch in it and also having name, duration and fees of course.<br>
And the second class batch is used to create various batch under the perticular course and batch is having date of starting, date of ending and list of the students who are opting that perticular batch under the perticular course.<br>
And the third class students is used to generate the student with different details of student like name, address, mobile number and all other required details.<br>
Last class is Main class and having the main functionality of admin and a student, a admin and a student is having various functionality which are as follows:<br>
<br>
Admin Functionality.....
  <br>
  <br>
  for using admin functionality you have to login as admin and I hard coded it so the credentials for admin are Username: admin, Password: admin (Case sensitive).<br>
  <br>
  1. Admin can create the course with name, duration and fees.<br>
  2. Admin can update the details of course. <br>
  3. admin can edit the details of course.<br>
  4. Admin can create a Batch under a course.(for this atleast one student should have signed up by this only admin can have any student data)<br>
  5. Admin can search for information about batches (by batch name, by start date, by end date).<br>
  6. Admin can update details of batch.<br>
  7. Admin can view student details.<br>
  8. Admin can view the student list of a batch.<br>

<br>
<br>
Student Functionality.....
<br>
<br>
  for using student functionality you have to login as student(if you have valid credential or you can sign up first to log in).
  <br>
  <br>
  1. Student can see his profile.<br>
  2. Student can update the profile. <br>
  3. Student can change the password but has to give older one password.<br>
  4. Student can see course but not having access to edit.<br>
  5. Student can see batches of the perticular course.<br>
  6. Student can register himself in a batch of perticular course.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
These were the some functionality of my application.
<br>
Thankyou.....
